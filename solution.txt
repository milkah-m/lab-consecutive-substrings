consecutiveSubstrings: I have created a function called consecutive substrings. 

LOGIC: This function follows these steps:
   //takes in a string as an input
   //converts the string into an array
   //creates an empty array to store the results of the for loop
   //loops through the string-array using a for loop inside an arrow function that is assigned to a constant variable
   //each iteration of the for loop:
      //uses .slice to copy the original string array from index 0 to 1+i (where i is the current element being iterated over)
      //the result of the slice is joined into a string with no separators and then pushed into the array created to store the result
      // this loop runs as long as i<stringArray.length, basically as long as each element has been iterated over
  //initiate a while loop that lasts as long as the length of the original array is greater than 0
      //this loop  runs the for loop and then removes the first element of the array (first word) until there are no elements left in the array
  //the function returns the new array of consecutive substrings

MY WHY: 
I chose nested loops because they allowed me to work with the combinations that i encountered in this problem rather efficiently, 
something that would not have been possible with a single loop. my for loop handles the individual cumulative array-building logic and my while loop handles the mutation.

BIG O NOTATION: The big O notation for my function is O(n^2). 
     //the scalable element is the length of newArray
     //the while loop targets an element for each loop
     //the for loop runs its logic inside that while loop each time
     //the loop within a loop gives me a big O notation of O(n^2) because each loop runs n times and when I combine that, I get n^2. n here represents the length of the array
